# Sentiment Analysis Project
# Author: Siddharth Sharma
# Date: January 14, 2025
# Description: This project leverages a pre-trained
# transformer model from the Hugging Face library to
# perform sentiment analysis on text data. It uses the
# "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
# model to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Step 1: Load Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer
# Description: This step loads a pre-trained sentiment analysis model
# and its associated tokenizer from the Hugging Face library.

# Load tokenizer and model

# Description: Initialize a sentiment analysis pipeline
# using the loaded model and tokenizer.

# Description: Test the sentiment analysis system with sample inputs.
